Hi, I'm Pallavi!

I’m a robotics enthusiast passionate about creating intelligent machines that interact with the physical world.  
I enjoy blending hardware, control systems, and software to bring robotic ideas to life.


1. What I'm Exploring:
. Microcontrollers: Arduino, NodeMCU (ESP8266), Rasberrypi 2 model B , NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX
. Programming: Python, C++, ROS2
. Mechanical Design: Fusion 360 , Solidworks
. Concepts: Sensor fusion, autonomous navigation, PID, kinematics


2. What I'm Building:
. Personal robotics projects (obstacle avoidance, walking bots, control systems)
. Currently focused on strengthening mechanics and electronics foundation



3. Currently Learning:
. Robot Operating System (ROS2)
. CAD modeling and structural analysis
. Basics of SLAM and motion planning


4. Goals for This Year:
. Document my projects publicly
. Start a robotics blog using Notion
. Contribute to open-source robotics packages

 
Let’s connect and collaborate!
